 NAME:
    MOMENT_CUBE
 PURPOSE:
    To take the 0th, 1st and 2nd moments of cubes.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    moment_str = moment_cube( data, hd_structure ) 

 INPUTS:
    DATA -- Data cube to be analyzed
    HD_STRUCTURE -- Structure from RDHD.pro containing header information.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    NOMASK -- Does not mask to include emission in moment.

 OUTPUTS:
    MOMENT_STR -- Structure containing moments of the emission in the
                  cube.

 NAME:
   SCF
 PURPOSE:
   To calculate the SCF on a data cube given a local patch.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   SCF, data, patch = patch, scf_0 = scf_0 [, scf_s = scf_s, 
     qcorr = qcorr, rms = rms, ss_mat = ss_mat, s0_mat = s0_mat,
     /renormalize]

 INPUTS:
   DATA -- Data cube to be analyzed (velocity on Axis 3)
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
   PATCH -- Weight to be given to the SCF local averaging.  Defaults
            to a 3 X 3 box with no weight on self correlation. 2D
            matrix with value of -1 at location of base spectrum.
            The base spectrum is the spectrum which is T_0 in the SCF
            literature.  The SCF for the comparison spectra (T_1) are
            calculated for all positions simultaneously.  
   RMS -- Map of the RMS in each pixel.  Needed for calculating the
          Quality correction.
   RENORMALIZE -- Generate SCF_0 1-[T_1-T_0]^2/(T_1^2+T_0^2) instead
                  of the literature's 1-sqrt([T_1-T_0]^2/(T_1^2+T_0^2)).
   SILENT -- Suppress progress text.
   CORRCALC -- Only calculate the correction value.

 OUTPUTS:
   SCF_0 -- Map of 0th order SCF.
   SCF_S -- Scaled SCF to maximize the correlation
   SS_MAT -- Matrix of the SCF_S function on the patch averaged for
             all the pixels in the map.
   S0_MAT -- As ss_mat, but for SCF_0
   QCORR -- Set flag to scale SCF products up by the Quality
            Correction to account for the presence of noise.
   CORRVAL -- Set this variable to contain the Median value of the
              correction that was applied.
   COUNTS -- Matrix containing the number of spectrum pairs that
             contribute to the average in each position of the patch. 
   CORRCALC -- Set this keyword to calculate Quality Correction and exit.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Fri Dec 17 18:30:46 2004, Erik Rosolowsky <eros@cosmic>
		Added correction flags and some quick exits if all you
		need is the correction.

       Thu Aug 14 13:22:52 2003, Erik Rosolowsky <eros@cosmic>
		Added in patch storing at all points and utilized
		JohnJohn's line counter.

       Added the square root renormalization (a la the literature)
       and added some commentary.  Tue Dec 17 16:32:51 2002, Erik
