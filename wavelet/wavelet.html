 NAME:
   ATROUS
 PURPOSE:
   Perform a 2-D "a trous" wavelet decomposition on an image.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   ATROUS, image [, decomposition = decomposition, $
                 filter = filter, n_scales = n_scales, /check]

 INPUTS:
   IMAGE -- A 2-D Image to Filter

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
   FILTER -- A 1D (!!) array representing the filter to be used.
             Defaults to a B_3 spline filter (see Stark & Murtaugh
             "Astronomical Image and Data Analysis", Spinger-Verlag,
             2002, Appendix A)
   N_SCALES -- Set to name of variable to receive the number of
               scales performed by the decomposition.
   CHECK -- Check number of scales to be performed and return.
 OUTPUTS: 
   DECOMPOSITION -- A 3-D array with scale running along the 3rd axis
                    (large scales -> small scales). The first plane
                    of the array is the smoothed image. To recover
                    the image at any scale, just total the array
                    along the 3rd dimension up to the scale desired.
                  

 RESTRICTIONS:
   Uses FFT convolutions which edge-wrap instead of mirroring the
   edges as suggested by Stark & Mutaugh.  Wait for it.

 NAME:
   BUILDMAT
 PURPOSE:
   To build the wavelet transform matrix for a given transform and scale.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   BUILDMAT, size, m = m, /SPARSE, nbound = nbound

 INPUTS:
   SIZE -- The (1-D) size of a matrix to fill

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
   NBOUND -- The size of the matrix to insert the transform matrix
             inside (NBOUND > SIZE).  The remainder of the matrix is
             filled with the identity matrix.
   /SPARSE -- Set this matrix to make sparse matrices.
 OUTPUTS:
   M -- The transform matrix.

 NAME:
    DWT
 PURPOSE:
    Subroutine to perform a discrete wavelet transform on a time series.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    DWT, X , wc = wc /trim, /expand, /pad, /inverse])

 INPUTS:
    X -- A 1-D or 2-D image

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    TRIM, EXPAND, PAD -- determine what to do if the time series is
                         not of length 2^n.  TRIM cuts to next lowest
                         power, EXPAND CONGRIDS to next highest
                         power, PAD fills with zeros.
    INVERSE -- Perform an inverse transform
    MIN, MAX -- Minimum and maximum scales to analyze.  Defaults to
                the smallest power encomapssing the wavelet for MIN
                and the entire array for MAX. Measured in pixels
    Wavelet Names -- /COIF2, /COIF3, /DEB4, /DEB6, or /HAAR
 OUTPUTS:
   WC -- The wavelet Coefficients.  This is a keyword set.

 EXAMPLE:
   To perform the Coiflet wavelet transform of order 3 on a time
   series:
    IDL> t = findgen(1024)      ; generate time vector
    IDL> x = sin(t/10)          ; generate time series
    IDL> dwt, x, wc = wc, /coif3; Perform transform
    IDL> plot, wc               ; Plots the wavelet coefficients

   To perform the inverse transform on wavelet coefficents WC
    IDL> dwt, wc, wc = x2, /coif3 ; Perform inv. transform
    IDL> plot, t, x2              ; Plot inv. transformed data

 RESTRICTIONS:
   Does everything with doubles.  Hope that's okay.  Passes extra
   keywords to GET_COEFFS (ultimately) so that the flag moderated
   GET_COEFFS doesn't need a lot of string matching.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Mon Jul 19 13:35:54 2004, Erik Rosolowsky <eros@cosmic>
		Removed extraneous assignment definition that hampered
		keywords.  Thanks to Harish Gadhavi for pointing this out.

 NAME:
   INTERLEAVE
 PURPOSE:
   For an 2N element array, the program interleaves the last N
   elements with the first N elements.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   output = INTERLEAVE(X, [, range, inverse = inverse])

 INPUTS:
  X -- A vector to be operated upon
  RANGE -- Perform INTERLEAVE on the first RANGE elements of the array.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
  INVERSE -- Instead of interleaving, separate every other element
             and move to the back.

 NOTES:
  For images, the interleaving is performed only on the columns of
  the matrix (the second dimension).
 
 OUTPUTS:
  OUTPUT -- the interleaved array.
